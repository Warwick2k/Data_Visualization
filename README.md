Communicate Data Findings
By Tobias Hagemann

Core of the analysis are the "Posprt Loan data". The file contains a huge amount of different loan related data mainly relating to the borrower's, their background and the loan conditions.

The data set is really tidied and clean so data wrangling is just a minor topic here. Main characteristic is the high number of columns and with that different contents.

The first real obvious finding is, that many entries are not valuable as they are too generic.
